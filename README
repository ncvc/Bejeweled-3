This was started when one of Chris' coworkers challenged everyone to beat her high score in Bejewled. Needless to say, we decided it would be easier to write a bot to do it for us, rather than learn to play ourselves.

Uses the autopy library found here: https://github.com/msanders/autopy (Only tested on Windows)

TODO:
* Make the lookaheads more efficient - right now it takes ~5s to look ahead just one move
	* Most likely an algorithmic improvement is the best solution, but other options would include multithreading or CUDA (which would be badass)
* Make the infinite replay functionality not suck
